    "1. What do REGION PROPOSALS entail?\n",
    "   - Region proposals are a crucial part of object detection systems, such as Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNNs). They involve the identification of potential regions or bounding boxes in an image that might contain objects of interest. These regions are proposed based on various methods, such as selective search or edge boxes, to reduce the computational load by focusing on a limited number of candidate regions for further object recognition and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What do you mean by NON-MAXIMUM SUPPRESSION? (NMS)\n",
    "   - Non-Maximum Suppression is a post-processing step in object detection to eliminate redundant and overlapping bounding boxes. After object detection algorithms like R-CNN propose multiple bounding boxes for the same object, NMS is applied to keep only the bounding box with the highest confidence score while suppressing or removing other overlapping boxes. It helps ensure that only one accurate bounding box is retained for each object in the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What exactly is mAP?\n",
    "   - mAP stands for Mean Average Precision, and it is a common evaluation metric used in object detection and information retrieval tasks. It measures the accuracy and precision of a model's predictions by considering the precision-recall curve for different classes or categories. mAP is calculated by taking the average of the precision values at different recall levels. It provides a single numerical value that summarizes the model's performance across multiple object classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a frames per second (FPS)?\n",
    "   - Frames per second (FPS) is a measurement of a system's or device's performance, particularly in video and computer graphics contexts. It represents the number of individual frames (images) displayed or processed in one second. In the context of computer vision or video processing, FPS indicates how quickly a system can process or display video frames, and higher FPS values generally indicate smoother and more real-time performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is an IOU (INTERSECTION OVER UNION)?\n",
    "   - IOU, which stands for Intersection over Union, is a metric used to evaluate the overlap or similarity between two bounding boxes or regions in object detection tasks. It is calculated by dividing the area of intersection between two bounding boxes by the area of their union. IOU is often used in non-maximum suppression (NMS) to determine how much overlap exists between proposed bounding boxes and to filter out redundant or overlapping boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Describe the PRECISION-RECALL CURVE (PR CURVE)\n",
    "   - The Precision-Recall Curve (PR curve) is a graphical representation used to assess the performance of binary classification models, particularly in cases where one class is rare or more critical than the other. It plots two key metrics against different classification thresholds:\n",
    "     - Precision: The ratio of true positives to the total number of predicted positive instances.\n",
    "     - Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positive instances.\n",
    "   The PR curve allows you to visualize how the precision and recall change at various classification thresholds, helping you choose an appropriate threshold that balances the trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the term \"selective search\"?\n",
    "   - Selective search is a region proposal method used in object detection systems. It is a heuristic approach that identifies potential object regions or bounding boxes in an image. Selective search works by grouping similar pixels into segments and then merging those segments hierarchically to generate a diverse set of region proposals. These proposals are used to reduce the search space for object detection algorithms like R-CNN, making them computationally more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Describe the R-CNN model's four components.\n",
    "   - The R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model consists of four main components:\n",
    "     1. Region Proposal Network (RPN): This component proposes potential bounding boxes (regions) in the input image.\n",
    "     2. CNN Feature Extractor: It extracts feature maps from the proposed regions and is pre-trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet).\n",
    "     3. Localization Module: Responsible for refining the region proposals and predicting more accurate bounding box coordinates.\n",
    "     4. Classification Module: It classifies the object within each region proposal and assigns a class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What exactly is the Localization Module?\n",
    "   - The Localization Module in an R-CNN is responsible for refining the region proposals produced by the Region Proposal Network (RPN). It aims to predict more accurate bounding box coordinates for the objects in the proposed regions. This step fine-tunes the bounding boxes to better align with the object's actual location within the region, improving localization accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are the R-CNN DISADVANTAGES?\n",
    "   - R-CNN models have several disadvantages, including:\n",
    "     - High computational and memory requirements, making them less efficient for real-time applications.\n",
    "     - Slow inference speed due to separate processing of each region proposal.\n",
    "     - Inefficiency in training, as each region proposal generates a separate forward and backward pass.\n",
    "     - Difficulty in handling object scale variations and large numbers of region proposals.\n",
    "     - Limited ability to generalize to unseen object categories, as it relies on pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction.\n",
    "     - Complexity in the multi-stage pipeline, making them less straightforward to implement and train compared to newer architectures like Faster R-CNN and SSD.\n"
